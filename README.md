# getgrass-bot

This repository contains the code for `getgrass-bot`, a bot designed to establish WebSocket connections through various HTTP and SOCKS proxies, specifically aimed at farming for Grass Airdrop Season 2.

## Overview

`getgrass-bot` connects to a specified WebSocket server using both HTTP and SOCKS proxies. It leverages the `ws` library for WebSocket communication and integrates the `https-proxy-agent` and `socks-proxy-agent` libraries for enhanced proxy support. This allows for more versatile and resilient connections, accommodating a wider range of proxy types.
